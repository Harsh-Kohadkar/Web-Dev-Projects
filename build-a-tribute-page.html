      <figcaption id="img-caption"> Nikola Tesla, (born July 9/10, 1856, Smiljan, Austrian Empire [now in Croatia]â€”died January 7, 1943, New York, New York, U.S.), Serbian American inventor and engineer who discovered and patented the rotating magnetic field, the basis of most alternating-current machinery. He also developed the three-phase system of electric power transmission. He immigrated to the United States in 1884 and sold the patent rights to his system of alternating-current dynamos, transformers, and motors to George Westinghouse. In 1891 he invented the Tesla coil, an induction coil widely used in radio technology.

        <b> Quotes by Nikola Tesla: </b>
        <ul>
        <li>If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration. </li>
<li> I don't care that they stole my idea . . I care that they don't have any of their own. </li>
<li> Of all things, I liked books best. </li>
<li> Be alone, that is the secret of invention; be alone, that is when ideas are born. </li>
<li> The present is theirs; the future, for which I really worked, is mine. </li>

          </ul>
